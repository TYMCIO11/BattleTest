# Battle Test 4.0

My little mod for M&B warband.

### If you want to test/edit:
1. Download [Mount and Blade Warband 2010](https://g.co/kgs/uU8ghfh) (Steam or no-Steam).
2. Download Python 2.X e.g.: [Python 2.7 release](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/).
3. Download [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) (you can use MS Notepad if you are strong enough).
4. Download latest version Module System folder (BT_vX) from Github.
5. Go to the Modules folder in game directory which is by default:  
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mount&Blade Warband\Modules\" (for no-Steam version),  
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MountBlade Warband\Modules" (for Steam version).
6. Duplicate the Native folder and change the name of the copy to: "BTest_vX".
7. Open module_info.py in the Module System folder with notepad and point to the export_dir to the moremercs folder:  
   export_dir = "C:/Program Files (x86)/Mount&Blade Warband/Modules/BTest_vX/" (for no-Steam version)  
   export_dir = "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/MountBlade Warband/Modules/BTest_vX/" (for Steam version)
      The forward slashes are used deliberately.
9. Run the build_module.bat file to apply all the changes to the moremercs module folder
10. Test/edit
